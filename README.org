* Fluent Regex
Ever thought that regex is a bit crap to write. Now it isnt with Fluent Regex.
Create regex search queries quickly and easily.

** Usage
#+begin_src csharp
var result = Regex.Start().MatchFromBeginningOfInput(a =>
{
    return a.AddSubexpression(b =>
        {
            return b.MatchTab()
                .AddSubexpression(c => c.MatchCharacterSet("A-Za-z")).EndSubexpression();
        }).EndSubexpression();
}).AsString();
#+end_src
#+RESULT:
/^(\t([A-Za-z]))

** What is the difference
- Fluent.Regex.Standard
  This is a netstandard 2.1 library. Use this for legacy applications
- Fluent.Regex.Core
  This is a net5.0 library. Use this for new applications.

Both are functionally identical
